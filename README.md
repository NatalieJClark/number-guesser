# Number Guesser Game

## Introduction

- This is my Number Guesser Game project for Makers SWE Specialism Module 1 - Learning Java & Its Tools
- It is a simple game where player one chooses a number and player two tries to guess it and receives helpful feedback ("higher" or "lower") from the program, to guide them in the right direction.

## Aims

- [x] Learn to create a Gradle project
- [x] Learn to test-drive programs in Java with JUnit

## Setup
```java
// Run the tests by running NumberGuesserTest.java
```
